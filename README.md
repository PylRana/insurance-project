During the course of conducting these reports and visualisation for selected data group, I've gained considerable amount of insight to different queries, which have provided outlooks for specific required information. As the data can be complex and the queries can focus on the target requirements.
For example: Cleaning and managing data effectively, where i have filtered and added new rows and successfully deleted specified dataset. 
In the process of filtering the information, key insights such as smokers incur higher average expense than non smokers and males being higher smokers than female. 

The visualisation dashboard presents a easy to grasp information as it represents the data in a visual format.
The dashbord focuses on simplifying data in a visual context such as bar chart, pie chart, histogram chart and packed chart. 
The dashboard, obtains the data from existing queries such as Gender specific smoker average expense, Region Specific average expense, Average BMI By Region and Total Expense by Region. These informations provide key insights for stakeholders such as Southeast has highest number of smokers, whereas southwest and northwest have less smokers. 
Due to the high smoking ratio, Southeast also the highest total expense. 

All of these are obtained from already existing data set and filtered queries and provides a easier visual representation for the users.
